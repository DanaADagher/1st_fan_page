        <li>Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game that has no required goals to accomplish, allowing players a large
          amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game. However, there is an achievement system,
          known as "advancements" in the Java Edition of the game, and "trophies" on the PlayStation ports.
          Gameplay is in the first-person perspective by default, but players have the option of a third-person
          perspective.The game world is composed of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes and fluids, and commonly called
          "blocks"—representing various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava. The core
          gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects. These blocks are arranged in a 3D grid, while
          players can move freely around the world. Players can "mine" blocks and then place them elsewhere, enabling
          them
          to build things.</li>
